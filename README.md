# CS590 - Lab 1

## Lab Description:
Create a web page that provides option for choosing different levels of education (e.g. bachelors, masters) and semester (e.g. Spring, Fall, Summer) and career option (e.g. Computer Science, Law)
On selecting the desired combination, the list of available classes with relevant information such as instructors, course description, prerequisites, credit hours, duration etc. should be displayed along with ratings and reviews for each course and instructor by previous students. Links for similar courses on MOOCs can also be provided.
Add an image and URL for each course. When any of them is clicked user is redirected to course registration page with details of total and available seats. After the user confirms registration, the page should display a success message and reflect the new numbers.
Use appropriate CSS for styling. Make the page responsive. (Check its responsiveness for different screen sizes.)

## Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery

## Knowledge Gained:
I re-familiarized myself with Bootstrap styling; particularly around the Grid system utilizing rows and columns.
I re-learned some JQuery and Javascript functions as well.
